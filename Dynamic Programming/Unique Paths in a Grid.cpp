/* Problem Statement :

Given a grid of size m * n, lets assume you are starting at (1,1) and your goal is to reach (m,n). At any instance, if you are on (x,y), you can either go to (x, y + 1) or (x + 1, y).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.

Example :

There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.

[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]

The total number of unique paths is 2.

Note: m and n will be at most 100.

Cpp code :

int Solution::uniquePathsWithObstacles(vector<vector<int> > &A) {
    int m = A.size(), n = A[0].size();
     
    vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
     
    if (A[0][0] == 0)
        dp[0][0] = 1;
         
    for(int i = 1; i < m; i++)
    {
        if (A[i][0] == 0)
            dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0];
    }
     
    for(int j = 1; j < n; j++)
    {
        if (A[0][j] == 0)
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1];
    }  
      
    for(int i = 1; i < m; i++)
    {
        for(int j = 1; j < n; j++)
        {
            if (A[i][j] == 0)
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1];
        } 
    }

    return dp[m-1][n-1];
}
